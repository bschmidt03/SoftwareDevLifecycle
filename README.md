Sprint Review and Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by listening to their goals and expectations and breaking them down into specific, actionable tasks. User stories simplify this by describing what users want and why, helping the team focus on delivering features that provide real value.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs by breaking the work into small, manageable pieces and delivering them iteratively. I hope to use Agile processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to stay organized, prioritize tasks, and continuously improve.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, staying accountable for your work, collaborating with others, and supporting the team’s shared goals. It’s about helping the team succeed while staying open to feedback and adapting as needed.
